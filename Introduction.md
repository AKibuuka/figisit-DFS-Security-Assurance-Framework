# Digital Financial Services Security Assurance Framework
Full report --> [DFS Security Assurance Framework]

# Introduction
The provision of digital finance services (DFS) involves a complex ecosystem with the participation of different stakeholders such as banks, DFS provider, mobile network operators (MNOs), DFS platform providers, regulators, agents, merchants, payment service providers, device manufacturers, application developers, token service providers, OEMs, and clients. The interconnectedness of these system entities and reliance on several parties in the ecosystem extends the security boundaries beyond the digital financial service (DFS) provider to the customers, network providers, mobile phone manufacturer, and other third-party providers in the ecosystem 

In addition, DFS providers must also deal with an increasingly complex mobile ecosystem, developing applications for multiple versions of operating systems each with their specific vulnerabilities and support different types of mobile devices. In this fast-evolving dynamic environment, DFS providers face certain challenges concerning knowledge about the actual security threats and possible security controls to mitigate the risks.
The DFS Security Assurance Framework provides an overview of the security threats and vulnerabilities facing the DFS providers (banks, non-banks providing mobile money services), mobile network operators, customers, payment system providers, merchants, and technology services/third-party service providers. Regulators including telecom authorities, banking, and payment regulators could also make use of the DFS Security Assurance Framework for establishing security baselines for the DFS providers as well.

The framework, when implemented, would complement established risk and information security management practices of the stakeholders involved in DFS ecosystem. For example, the security control measures in the document can be included as part of the ICT Security programme of the DFS provider.
The DFS Security Assurance Framework recommends a structured methodology for managing security risks that the DFS providers offering digital financial services could implement to:
* Identify security vulnerabilities and related threats within the ecosystem.
* Establish security controls to provide end to end security.
* Strengthen management practices with respect to security risk management that is inclusive of all DFS stakeholders.

The DFS Security Assurance Framework provides a systematic security risk management process for assessing threats and vulnerabilities and identifies appropriate security control measures to be implemented by the DFS provider and mobile network operator for threats targeting the user, mobile device, mobile network operator and DFS provider. Threats related to merchants, payment service providers and other financial services organizations and the specific mitigations for addressing the threats that they face are out of scope for this document. The report complements the work undertaken under the Cybersecurity workstream in the Security, Infrastructure, and Trust Working Group, on the methodology for financial services organizations to manage and respond to cybersecurity incidents.
The DFS Security Assurance framework consists of the following components:
* A security risk management methodology based on ISO/IEC 27005 –Security techniques -Information security risk management (Section 7 of the report).
* Assessment of threats and vulnerabilities to the underlying infrastructure of the mobile network operator and DFS provider, DFS applications, services, network operations and third-party providers involved in the ecosystem for DFS delivery.
* Mitigation strategies based on the outcome of (b) above. 

The mitigation measures identify 117 security controls for the security threats which are outlined in Section 8 of the report.

The DFS Security Assurance Framework provides an overview of the security threats and vulnerabilities facing the DFS providers (banks, non-banks providing mobile money services), mobile network operators, customers, payment system providers, merchants, and technology services/third-par- ty service providers. Regulators including telecom authorities, banking and payments regulators could also make use of the DFS Security Assurance Framework for establishing security baselines for the DFS providers as well.
The framework when implemented would complement established risk and information security management practices of the stakeholders involved in DFS ecosystem. For example, the security control

## ITU-T RECOMMENDATION X.805 OVERVIEW
The Security Assurance Framework uses the ITU-T Recommendation X.805 as its foundation for apply- ing security control measures to achieve end-to-end network security, it also largely suggests controls based on the recommendations in the technical report “Security Aspects of Digital Financial Services”2 by the ITU-T Focus group Digital Financial Services.
The end-to-end communications environment of the DFS ecosystem is considered in terms of the ITU-T Recommendation X.805 and provides a useful reference framework for security management. The ITU-T Recommendation X.805 security architecture has eight ‘security dimensions’, which are measures designed to address a particular aspect of network security.
The eight security dimensions that provide a sys- tematic way of encountering network threats are as follows.

* Access control: Protection against unauthorized use of network resources.
* Authentication: Methods of confirming the identi- ties of communicating entities.
* Non-repudiation: Methods to prevent an individ- ual or entity from denying cause of an event or action.
* Data confidentiality: Protection of data from unauthorized disclosure.
* Communication security: Assurance that infor- mation only flows between authorized endpoints without being diverted or intercepted.
* Data integrity: Protection of the correctness and accuracy of data.
* Availability: Prevention of denial of authorized access to network elements and data.
* Privacy: Protection of data information that might be derived from observing network activity.

### The following vulnerabilities  identified in the framework with an auditing guideline based on the controls.
* [Account and Session Hijacking]
* [Attacks against credentials] 
* [Attacks against systems and platforms]
* [Code Exploitation Attacks]
* [Data Misuse]
* [Denial of Service Attacks] 
* [Insider Attacks]
* [Man-in-the-middle and social engineering attacks]
* [Compromise of DFS Infrastructure]
* [SIM attacks]
* [Compromise of DFS Services]
* [Unauthorized access to DFS data]
* [Malware]
* [Zero-Day Attacks]
* [Rogue Devices]
* [Unauthorised Access to Mobile Devices]
* [Unintended Disclosure of Personal Information]
